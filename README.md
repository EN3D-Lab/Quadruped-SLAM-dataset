# Quadruped-SLAM-dataset
A quadruped SLAM dataset covering diverse locomotion behaviors in complex environments.

The dataset was acquired on the campus of Shenzhen University, using a Unitree Go2 quadruped robot equipped with a Hesai XT16 360° LiDAR and a 360° prism. A Leica TS60 total station was employed to track the prism in real time, providing millimeter-level ground-truth trajectories.

In total, 12 data sequences were collected, covering diverse environments such as soft grass, rigid concrete, slopes, staircases, underground parking lots, narrow corridors, and long straight roads:

The quadruped robot states in these datasets encompass lying prone, walking, stair climbing, running, as well as locomotion disturbances and observational instabilities (e.g., foot slippage, loss of balance and recovery). The dataset details are summarized as follows:

To facilitate reproducibility and further research, the dataset will be made publicly available after the acceptance of our paper.
